# Bingo Kata

## Introduction

This repository is a development of the kata [Feature 1 - Playing Bingo](http://agilekatas.co.uk/katas/Bingo-Kata) as an exercise for applying TDD methodology.

## How To Start

1. If you don't have it already, [install Composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/).
2. Run `composer install` in order to install all the required packages.

## Usage

Run all the checks: `composer test`. This will do some checks that you can perform with isolated commands:
1. [PHP Parallel Lint](https://github.com/JakubOnderka/PHP-Parallel-Lint): `composer lint`.
2. [PHP Style Check](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer): `composer style`. If you want to fix style issues automatically: `composer fix-style`.
3. [PHP Unit](https://phpunit.de/): `composer phpunit`.
